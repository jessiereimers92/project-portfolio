        <h2>Video #1</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>'10 Things I Didn't Know about HTML'</li>
            <li>Speaker: Mathias Bynens</li>
            <li><a href="http://vimeo.com/89935203">Link to Video</a></li>
            <li>My Thoughts: 	This video was pretty interesting and for the most part, pretty informative. Before I even started watching the video, I figured that just from the title, if Bynens, a professional web developer, didn’t know these ten things, I wouldn’t know them either. However, at some times, I was a little confused, like with the first tip about “&amp;” and “&gt;”. Then, he started talking about JavaScript and I had no idea what he was talking about. I think if I knew more about JavaScript, I would have enjoyed the video more. Towards the end, Bynens started using the words truthy and falsy. At first, I was really confused and didn’t understand but then I looked it up. I was still a little confused but I realized it has to do with JavaScript codes.</li>
            <li>Three Things I Learned
                <ol>
                    <li>When writing HTML, you can omit the head, body, and HTML opening and closing tags and the HTML is still valid because the browser automatically generates the tags.</li>
                    <li>If the name of the font family has spaces, you don't need to put the qutoes around it.</li>
                    <li>Boolean means true or false in programming.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Video #2</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>'Front End Legos: Better Design with Reusable HTML &amp; CSS'</li>
            <li>Speaker: Shay Howe</li>
            <li><a href="http://confreaks.com/videos/2230-html5tx2013-front-end-legos-better-design-with-reusable-html-css">Link to Video</a></li>
            <li>My Thoughts: I really liked this video and thought a lot of this video was really interesting because we’ve talked about and done some of the stuff Howe talks about in class. He talks a lot about accommodating content and using the different divs so they work best in code. He mentions adding more than one class names in a div so that it can be easier to use the classes for different things without it getting too complicated or confusing. I also liked the video because I understood most of what he was talking about. I felt that a majority of what he said was applicable to someone like me who is just starting to learn code. I also liked that he talked about using classes a lot because we use classes all the time when we write code.</li>
            <li>Three Things I Learned
                <ol>
                    <li>Avoid using too many nested selectors like "#main" or ".spotlight."</li>
                    <li>Use low specificity.</li>
                    <li>Use understandable or good names for classes.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>

        <h2>Video #3</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>'Don't Fear the Internet</li>
            <li>Speaker: Russ Maschmeyer</li>
            <li><a href="http://vimeo.com/24006296">Link to Part 1</a> <a href="http://vimeo.com/25665411">Link to Part 2</a> <a href="http://vimeo.com/27833342">Link to Part 3</a></li>
            <li>My Thoughts: I think I liked these videos the most out of all the ones I watched. They were put together well and I just liked the way they set the videos up. The videos were funny, but at the same time they explained things very well. The explanations were simple and to the point and the humor didn’t get in the way of what they were trying to say. We’ve already learned most of what Maschmeyer talked about in the videos yet I wasn’t bored or wishing for the videos to be over. I think in the future I might go back and watch more of Maschmeyer’s videos just to see if there is more I can learn or even just review.</li>
            <li>Three Things I Learned
                <ol>
                    <li>There are two kinds of websites: static and dynamic.</li>
                    <li>There are three ways to add CSS to your website: inline stying, internal CSS, and external CSS.</li>
                    <li>For colors, you can either use the # symbolr or rgb and then the rgb values of that color.</li>
                </ol>
