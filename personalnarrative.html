    <h1>Personal Narrative</h1>

    <div class="narrative">
    <p>   For my final project, I made a website that is a guide to Madrid. Each page is a different category: Home, About, Restaurants, Clubs and Bars, Important Places to Visit, and Other. The home page summarized what the website would have. The about page says a little about me and how I studied abroad in Madrid for a semester, which is why my website is credible. I used paddings and margins for the header and h2. I didn’t need to use margins or padding in my footer because I made my link to Flick and the Font Awesome icon an unordered list with no list style and aligned in the center. For the images, I added a padding of 5px, otherwise they would have been too close to the header and would have cut of some of the letters. I had big color scheme with eight colors but I ended up only using four of the colors because some of them were too similar or wouldn’t work with the background color I chose. I also made the hover and visited links a different color so it would be easier to tell what is a link and which link people have already visited. I used unordered and ordered lists for all the information I put on the page. I put the unordered list inside the ordered list. This was a challenge because when I went to validate my HTML it said I couldn’t put an unordered list in an ordered list. I had to put the close tag for li after the all the information in the unordered list for that number in the list. Once I did that, it validated correctly.</p>

<p>For all the pages, I added a header and put my h1 in the header. The header is just the title of the page, like Restaurants or About. Then I created a div class around the rest of the information I wanted to put on the page. I used a div around all of that because I wanted to be able to give all that information the padding and margin without doing that for the header/h1. A big challenge I had was deciding if I wanted to put a lot of pictures on each page. If I wanted to, I could have added two columns and had the information on the left and the pictures of the places I was naming on the right. In the end, I decided not to do that because there are too many places and I couldn’t pick which ones I wanted to show. So instead, in the footer I added a link to my Flickr page that has a bunch of pictures of the places I mentioned. I also added the Font Awesome icon for Flickr. At first it wasn’t showing up and I couldn’t figure out why. I looked at the other projects that I used Font Awesome on and copy and pasted that code into the footer so I could write the code for my Flickr one exactly like that but it still wasn’t working. I thought maybe I needed to put something in my head section so I went back and looked at the other projects I used Font Awesome on. I couldn’t find anything so I figured I was just writing the code wrong. Then I asked you and told me I needed the Font Awesome link in my head tag and I went back and looked. I realized that I was looking at the right link but I just didn’t think it was it because it says bootstrap in the code. So once I copy and pasted that into my page it worked fine. I have two images on my page, one on the home page and one on the about page. I wanted them to be centered so in order to do that I had to create a div around the src for each image and then in my CSS I had to add the text-align center for both of them.</p>

<p>For my page, I used a Bootstrap navigation bar. However, at first I wasn’t sure if I wanted to use nav tabs or nav pills or a navbar. In the end I chose a navbar because I think it looked better than the tabs or pills. I customized it by using the option "inverse", which made the navbar black with white words instead of the opposite. I did that because I didn't like the way the white looked with my color scheme. I also added my own names for the tabs that lead to the different pages on the navbar. Overall, I didn't have too much trouble creating my final project and I'm pretty happy with the final outcome. </p>
